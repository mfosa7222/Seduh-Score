# Changelog — Seduh Score

---

## [3.1.1] — Jun 2025

### BBTC
- **Home button** — added ← Home to the header. Navigates back to the dashboard, matching Throwdown behaviour.
- **Fix: Finalise handler invalid tab** — `fin` handler had three consecutive `S.tab=` assignments from iterative edits; the first set tab to `'matches'`, a key that does not exist in BBTC. Collapsed to a single expression: bracket match → `'bracket'`, prelim → `'prelims'`, fallback → `'prelims'`.

## [3.1.0] — Jun 2025

### BBTC
- **Fix: Judge selection broken on create match form** — stray semicolon in `rCreateForm()` cut off judge pill buttons from the DOM silently. Fixed.
- **Fix: Demo button non-functional** — `load-demo` handler was never registered in `bind()`. Fixed.
- **Fix: Demo card on wrong tab** — demo card was injected into Bracket tab instead of Setup. Fixed.
- **PDF round grouping** — match results table now has a coloured section header per round (Preliminary = grey, QF = blue, SF = amber, Finals = green).
- **Audience view label** — corrected from "Standings" to "Preliminary Standings".
- **Audience view match colour coding** — result rows tinted and tagged by round.
- **Edit button on completed bracket matches** — consistent with preliminary match card behaviour.
- **Demo mode** — Setup tab. 8 teams, 3 judges, 12 prelim matches, QF in progress. Confirms before overwriting live data.

### Throwdown
- **7 min timer preset** — added for Girls Got Drip format.
- **Redemption cap** — max number revived from redemption pool. `0` = no limit.
- **Wild card revival** — optional per-round toggle. Randomly revives one loser after each completed main round. Skip available. Disabled from QF and above.
- **Demo mode** — Girls Got Drip Vol. 0 format: 12 participants, redemption R1 cap 4, Round 3 in progress.

### Platform
