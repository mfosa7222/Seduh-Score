## What it does

The app is used by the competition secretary to manage matches in real time, from setup through to the final standings.

- Register teams and a judge pool
- Create matches manually — pick the round, two teams, and 3 judges from the pool
- Score each match drink-by-drink using shared token logic (max 3 tokens per cup, split between both teams)
- Automatic winner bonus, manual fastest-team and signature beverage bonuses
- Live leaderboard with configurable quarter-finals cutline
- Audience view for projector display
- Export results as PDF (print-ready, A4) or CSV (full cup-by-cup data)
- All data persists in the browser — survives refreshes and tab closes
